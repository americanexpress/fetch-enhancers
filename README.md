### Installation

```bash
npm install --save @americanexpress/fetch-enhancers
```

### Fetch Enhancers

Each fetch enhancer follows the same pattern:
* Called with any arguments required for configuration `fetchEnhancer(configuration)`
* Return a function which takes a fetch client as the sole argument  `fetchEnhancer(configuration)(fetch)`


#### createTimeoutFetch [Server & Browser]

`createTimeoutFetch` makes use of the [AbortController](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) to abort requests which exceed the given time limit.


##### Configuring

`createTimeoutFetch` takes a single argument which sets the default timeout.

```js
const enhancedTimeoutFetch = createTimeoutFetch(6e3)(fetch);
```

When called, the enhanced fetch will accept an additional option, `timeout`, allowing for the
default timeout value to be overridden for a single request.

```js
const slowRequest = timeoutFetch('https://example.com/some-slow-api', { timeout: 10e3 });
```

##### Example

```js
import { createTimeoutFetch } from '@americanexpress/fetch-enhancers';

// set your default timeout
const timeoutFetch = createTimeoutFetch(6e3)(fetch);

// Then use timeoutFetch as you would normally
const request = timeoutFetch('https://example.com');
request.then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });

// each request can override the default timeout
const fastRequest = timeoutFetch('https://example.com/fast', { timeout: 1e3 });
```

#### createBrowserLikeFetch [Server only]

`createBrowserLikeFetch` is for use on the server only. It enables the forwarding of
cookies and headers from the request made to the host server to trusted outbound requests made during
a server side render. Cookies which are returned are stored for the life of the host servers requests
allowing those cookies to be included, when valid, on subsequent requests.

##### Configuring

`createBrowserLikeFetch` accepts the following named arguments:

###### `headers`

Object containing any headers to be included on fetch requests.

An example of how you could build the headers

```js
const parseHeaders = (req) => ({
  Referer: url.format({
    protocol: req.protocol,
    hostname: req.hostname,
    pathname: req.path,
  }),
  cookie: req.headers.cookie,
});

const headers = parseHeaders(req);
const fetchWithRequestHeaders = createBrowserLikeFetch({
  headers,
  hostname: req.hostname,
  setCookie: res.cookie,
  trustedDomains: [/example\.com/],
})(mockFetch);
```

###### `hostname`

Hostname which should be derived from the Host HTTP header. Used to determine if set `setCookie` will be called. If using Express this can be retrieved from the [`req`](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#req.hostname) object.

###### `res`

Typically this would be an [Express response](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) object. `createBrowserLikeFetch`
makes use of the [cookie](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.cookie) function to set cookies on the response.

If you wish to provide your own function to set cookies, use [setCookie](#set-cookie).

> `res.cookie()` function provided by express requires [`this`](https://github.com/expressjs/express/blob/master/lib/response.js#L833) to be set
> to the context of the express middleware.

###### `setCookie`

This takes precedence over `res.cookie`.

`setCookie(name, value [, options])`

A callback function invoked when a fetch response contains cookies with a domain which matches to the given hostname.
This can be used to set the cookie on a response object.

`setCookie` is called with the same options as though it's the [Express response cookie](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res.cookie) function.
If you are passing in your own setCookie function it is important to note that the `maxAge` option will be in milliseconds.

If desired you can use `setCookie` to add additional checks or modify options passed to `req.cookie`.

```js
const buildStringURIEncodingSetCookie = (res) => (name, value, options) => {
  res.cookie(name, value, { ...options, encode: String });
};

const fetchWithRequestHeaders = createBrowserLikeFetch({
  headers,
  hostname: req.hostname,
  setCookie: (name, value, options) => res.cookie(name, value, {
    ...options, encode: String,
  }),
  trustedDomains: [/example\.com/],
})(mockFetch);
```

###### `trustedDomains`

A list of [regular expressions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) used to test the path given to fetch when making a request.
If the test is successful the enhanced fetch will include provided cookies.

```js
const trustedDomains = [/api\.example\.com/, /another\.example\.com/];
```

##### Example

```js
const parseHeaders = (req) => ({
  Referer: url.format({
    protocol: req.protocol,
    hostname: req.hostname,
    pathname: req.path,
  }),
  cookie: req.headers.cookie,
  'some-header': req.headers['some-header'] || '1234',
});

const fetchWithRequestHeaders = createBrowserLikeFetch({
  headers: parseHeaders(req),
  hostname: req.hostname,
  setCookie: res.cookie,
  trustedDomains: [/example\.com/],
})(mockFetch);

fetchWithRequestHeaders('https://example.com', {
  credentials: 'include',
});
```

### Composing fetch enhancers

You can chain together multiple enhancers to build a specific enhanced fetch client

```js
import { createTimeoutFetch } from '@americanexpress/fetch-enhancers';
import { yourFetch } from './safeFetch';

const timeoutFetch = createTimeoutFetch(6e3)(fetch);
const myTimeoutFetch = yourFetch(/* options for configuring yourFetch */)(timeoutFetch);

// use the enhanced fetch as you would normally
const response = myTimeoutFetch('https://example.com');
```

You can also use Redux's `compose` function

```js
import { compose } from 'redux';
import { createTimeoutFetch } from '@americanexpress/fetch-enhancers';
import { yourFetch } from './safeFetch';

const enhancedFetch = compose(
  yourFetch(),
  createTimeoutFetch(6e3)
)(fetch);

// Then use the enhanced fetch as you would normally
const request = enhancedFetch('https://example.com');
request.then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
```

### Creating your own fetch enhancer

Each enhancer must return a function which accepts `fetch` as a single argument.

```js
const strictCookieFetch = ({ allowSameOrigin }) => (nextFetch) => {
  (url, arguments_) => nextFetch(url, {
    ...arguments_,
    // use config arg allowSameOrigin
    credentials: allowSameOrigin ? 'same-origin' : 'omit',
  });
};

const safeFetch = strictCookieFetch()(fetch);
```
